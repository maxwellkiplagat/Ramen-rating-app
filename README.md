This project is tasting my understanding in javascript with HTML and css alltogether. It mainly works where a user can the dish he or she wants and it comes to to display the final food with the details the user entered, some of the parameters i had in this project was the Name of the dish,Reasturant,the image url of the dish,the rating and the comment he or she gives. This finaly gives the detail if the user finally finishes rating another person is able to see it.
